  <h1>Ben's Hobbies</h1>  
  <hr/><hr/>
  <P>This is a page dedicated to showing off a few of my hobbies! I tend to fall into 
  rabbit holes and frequently change gears, so expect fequent updates!</p>
  <br/>
  <h2>Computers/ Programming </h2>
  <p>After a somewhat tepid beginning, programming has fast become a subject that 
  perfectly fuels my love of learning. I love getting absorbed with researching a 
  subject, and with programming there's always a new language, technology, or 
  feature, and seemingly every new discovery is deeply interconnected with what you 
  already know.</p>
  <p>Additionally, I've started a new journey recently of teaching myself Linux! I 
  had friend back in middle school who first introduced me to Linux (or ubuntu, more
  specifically), but I never truely understood nor cared about what it was capable of
  until recently. I have fallen in love with the power and granularity of control that
  comes along with learning the command line, and look forward to expanding my 
  knowledge even more.</p>
  Here are some of the things I've been reading up on recently!
  <ul>
  <li>Java </li>
  <li>Python </li>
  <li>HTML  </li>
  <li>CSS  </li>
  <li>JavaScript  </li>
  <li>Ruby  </li>
  <li>Git/Github </li>
  <li>Docker </li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <p>Below is a picture of my desktop setup at home that I use for all of my coding, 
  video games, and a bunch of other stuff! The picture is pretty old, and changes 
  have been made since it was taken, but the general layout remains the same!</p>

  <h2>Music  </h2>
  <p>I am also a huge music lover. I was a percussionist in my school band from 4th 
  grade through to senior year of high school, and I picked up a love for many other
  instruments along the way. I have included a list of instruments that I've played, 
  and done my best to rank them in order of my proficiency. Keep in mind that the vast 
  majority of my ability with these instruments (with the exception of maybe 1 and 2) 
  could be described as "mediocre at best".</p>
  <ol>
  <li> Drums (specifically timpani) </li>
  <li> Piano </li>
  <li> Guitar </li>
  <li> Didgeridoo </li>
  <li> Bass </li>
  <li> Tuba </li>
  <li> Trombone </li>
  <li> Euphonium </li>
  <li> Hurdy Gurdy </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>SURPRISE!</h2>
  <p>I lied about one of the instruments in the above list! Can you guess which one?
  </p>
  <p>Here's a hint: I've included a link to a picture of one of the instruments I didn't
  lie about to help you rule it out!
