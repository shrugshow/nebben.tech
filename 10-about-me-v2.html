  <h1>About Ben</h1>  
<h2>Hey there!</h2>
<p>My name is Ben, and I'm a 26 year old aspiring hand-model. Though not many people 
pursue this esteemed profession, I have been enamored with the industry ever since I 
saw my very first nail polish magazine ad. Who knew a mere hand could employ such poise
 and grace? Ever since then, my dream has been to dress like a businessman from the 
elbow down and have someone take picutes of me wearing a rolex. My father would always 
joke and say "This isn't what I imagined when my son said he wanted to become a Handy 
Man". 
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I enjoy long walks on the beach, Barry Manilow, and rainy days. My 
hobbies include:
</p>
<ul class = "li">
<li> high fives</li>
<li> waving</li>
<li> clapping</li>
<li> handball</li>
</ul>
<p> I've finally decided on 
putting myself out there and looking for that special someone! Hopefully this show can 
lend me a helping hand!
Not to overplay my hand, but I think I'd make a 
spectacular contestant on this season of "The Bachelorette". Though sometimes I realize I can be a handful, I also know that I'm hands-down the right man for the show.
With any luck, by this time next year I'll be taking the next Bachelorette's hand in marraige!
