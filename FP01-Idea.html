  <h1>FP01-Idea</h1>
  <p>
  My idea for my website is a sort of a combination of a professional portfolio as well as my own person 
  experimenting grounds. I have been hugely enjoying learning about different languages and technologies, 
  and I would love to have a website that showcases some of the programs I've built, has a blog section for 
  new things I've been researching and learning about, and has a section for my resume, "about me" and "contact  
  me" pages for (hopefully) any professional opportunities.
