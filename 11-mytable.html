	  <th class = "theader">Subject</th>
	  <th class = "theader">Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td class = "tsubject">Java </td>
	  <td class = "tdesc"> Java was the first programming language I learned, and continues to be the one that I'm most 
	  comfortable in to this day! I have been flipping back and forth between reading "Java: The Complete 
	  Reference" by Herbert Schildt, and reading "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin to try and get a better handle 
	  on not only the different features and tools of the language, but also best practices in making my code legible 
	  and editable in the future.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">Python </td>
      <td class = "tdesc">I started looking into Python pretty shortly after beginning to learn Java. I had heard that 
	  Python was a bit more lax than Java, and was interested to see what the differences were between the languages. 
      I have since let Python take somewhat of a backseat to Java, as I have found that them both being object-oriented
      languages makes it relatively straight-forward to transfer ideas from one to the other.</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">Linux</td>
      <td class = "tdesc">As I mentioned briefly in the above paragraph, I was first introduced to Ubuntu back in middle school but was
      generally uninterested in learning about how it worked. In learning about programming, however, I have been 
      reintroduced to Linux as a development tool and decided that it's about time I become fluent in more operating systems
	  than just Windows. So far I have read through "Conquering the Command Line: Unix and Linux Commands for Developers" by 
	  Mark Bates, and am currently working through "The Linux Bible" by Christopher Negus.</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
	  <td class = "tsubject">HTML  </td>
	  <td class = "tdesc">HTML was ostensibly my first foray into coding (if one considers HTML "coding"). Before I 
	  knew anything about languages like Java and even before I knew basic control structures, I learned how to 
	  format a page with basic HTML tags. My understanding of this, and how it ties into other technologies has
	  grown over the past few months, and I plan on experiemnting with embedding Java Applets within my HTML soon.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">CSS  </td>
      <td class = "tdesc">CSS is normally learned alongside HTML in order to add personal flair to (or "style") one's 
	  webpages. For me it was no different, and while I can't say that I've put as much time into learning css as 
	  I have with other technologies, it is something that I would like to become fully proficient at.</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">JavaScript  </td>
	  <td class = "tdesc">JavsScript completes the front-end trifecta (HTML, CSS, JS), however this is the one of the 
	  three that I know the least about so far! I look forward to learning more about this language this semester.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">Ruby  </td>
	  <td class = "tdesc">In my search for free online learning tools, one of the things I heard talked about over
		over again was "The Odin Project". This is a free, online, full-stack web development bootcamp. They have (from when
		I last checked) two curriculums available: Ruby/RubyonRails or JavaScript/JSNode. I decided to start with the
		Ruby/RubyonRails curriculum because it also dabbled into the javascript and JSNode aspects of things, while the other 
		curriculum did not touch on Ruby at all. Since starting to learn about and code in this language, I've found it pretty
		easy to work with and wrap my head around. But I've only just started to dabble!</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">Git/Github </td>
	  <td class = "tdesc">I knew about Github from following programming subreddits and reading about the subject, but
I never fully understood what a version control system was. While I still can't say that I have a ton of experience 
with the technology, I've been doing a lot of reading and have become familiar with the terminology. Additionally, I may
try to make a pull request on an Open Source project for this year's Hacktober! Fingers crossed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">Rust</td>
	  <td class = "tdesc">I saw an article online about stack overflow's poll for the community's most loved/hated/etc 
programming language of 2019. Rust was at the top of the list for the most loved languages. Having never used rust, 
nor read anything about it, I decided to start doing some research. I have since discovered that Rust is a great
language for systems development as it has a low overhead and implements things like type-safety and file-permissions. 
I look forward to learning more about Rust in the future.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
      <td class = "tsubject">Docker </td>
	  <td class = "tdesc">In my readings and research, I kept running into brief references to Docker or "containerization" 
but didn't have much of a frame of knowledge for what that was. I have since done more reading on the subject, and while
I don't think it's anything I'll be implementing in the near near future, I'm happy to say I'm at least passingly familiar 
with the idea.</td>
